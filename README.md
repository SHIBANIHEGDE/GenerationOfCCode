## Output:
 The output will be auto-generated C code as per user requirement.

## Approaches Followed:
  * Using simple string matching algorithm to convert it to C code
  * Making use of Lex to tokenize and Yacc to specify the grammer to convert it to corresponding C Code and generate Abstract Syntax Tree for visualization
